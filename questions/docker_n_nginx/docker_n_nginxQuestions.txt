Based on the provided files and your request to focus on Docker configuration and NGINX, here are some questions to help you prepare for your interview:

### Docker Configuration Questions:
1. **What is the purpose of the `context` and `dockerfile` fields in the `build` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file?**
2. **Why are different Python versions used in the `client` and `api` Dockerfiles (`python:3.11-slim` vs `python:3.8-slim`)? How might this affect compatibility?**
3. **What is the significance of the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` environment variable in both Dockerfiles?**
4. **Why is `curl` installed in the `api` Dockerfile but not in the `client` Dockerfile?**
5. **What does the `EXPOSE 8000` directive in the `api` Dockerfile do, and how does it relate to the `ports` 
    configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file?**
6. **What is the purpose of the `PYTHONPATH=/app` environment variable in both Dockerfiles?**
7. **How does the `CMD` instruction in the Dockerfiles differ between the `client` and `api` services? What does `-X dev` do in the `client` service?**

### NGINX Configuration Questions:
8. **What is the role of the `nginx` service in this setup, and how does it interact with the `client` service?**
9. **What does the `upstream client_servers` block in the `nginx.conf` file do?**
10. **Why are multiple ports (`5000-5005`) exposed in the `nginx` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file?**
11. **What is the purpose of the `proxy_pass` directive in the `nginx.conf` file, and how does it facilitate communication between NGINX and the `client` service?**
12. **What do the `proxy_set_header` directives in the `nginx.conf` file do, and why are they important?**
13. **How does the `listen 5000-5005` directive in the `nginx.conf` file relate to the `ports` configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file?**
14. **What would happen if the `nginx.conf` file was not mounted as a volume in the `nginx` service?**
15. **How does NGINX handle load balancing in this setup, and what would you need to change to add more `client` service instances?**

### Advanced Docker and NGINX Questions:
16. **How would you modify the `nginx.conf` file to handle SSL/TLS termination for secure communication (HTTPS)?**
17. **What would you need to change in the `docker-compose.yml` file to add health checks for the `api` and `client` services?**
18. **How would you configure NGINX to serve static files for the `client` service?**
19. **If you wanted to add rate limiting to the `api` service via NGINX, how would you implement it in the `nginx.conf` file?**
20. **How would you debug an issue where the `client` service is not reachable through NGINX?**

These questions should help you deepen your understanding of Docker configuration and NGINX in the context of the provided files. Good luck with your interview!

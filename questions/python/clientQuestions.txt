Got it! Based on the provided Python client architecture (`app.py` and `file_gen.py`), Iâ€™ll design **more specific and detailed questions** that focus on the **code implementation**, **specific classes/functions**, and **how to modify or replace parts of the code**. These questions will help you dive deeper into the architecture and understand the inner workings of the code.

20. **How does the `FileGenerator` class create large files efficiently using `f.seek(size_bytes - 1)`?**
21. **What would happen if the `output_dir` directory does not exist? How does the `os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)` line handle this?**
22. **How would you modify the `FileGenerator` class to generate files with random content instead of empty files?**
23. **What changes would you make to the `FileGenerator` class to support generating files of specific formats (e.g., CSV, JSON)?**
24. **How would you handle disk space exhaustion during file generation in the `FileGenerator` class?**

### **3. Questions About Error Handling and Logging**

25. **How does the `logger` object work in the `app.py` and `file_gen.py` files? What logging level is used, and how would you change it?**
26. **What would happen if the `api` service returns a 500 error during file upload? How does the `retry_strategy` handle this?**
27. **How would you modify the error handling in the `create_and_upload_file` function to log detailed error messages (e.g., stack traces)?**
28. **What changes would you make to the `trigger_all_containers` function to log the status of each container's upload process?**
29. **How would you implement a retry mechanism for file generation in the `FileGenerator` class if the initial attempt fails?**

30. **How would you optimize the `create_and_upload_file` function to reduce memory usage during chunked uploads?**
31. **What changes would you make to the `FileGenerator` class to generate files faster (e.g., using memory-mapped files)?**
32. **How would you implement a caching mechanism in the `client` service to avoid redundant file generation?**
33. **What would you do to improve the performance of the `trigger_all_containers` function when dealing with a large number of containers?**
34. **How would you handle rate limiting in the `client` service to avoid overwhelming the `api` service?**

### **5. Questions About Testing and Debugging**

35. **How would you write unit tests for the `FileGenerator` class to ensure it generates files correctly?**
36. **What tools or techniques would you use to test the `create_and_upload_file` function's interaction with the `api` service?**
37. **How would you simulate network failures or high latency to test the retry mechanism in the `client` service?**
38. **What logging improvements would you make to help debug issues in the `client` service?**
